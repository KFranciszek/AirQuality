Air Quality App is an interactive tool designed to provide users with historical and current air quality data.
Utilizing data from a wide range of air quality monitoring stations, the application presents an in-depth view of air pollution levels across different geographical locations.

Features
1.Search for Measurement Stations by City: Users can quickly find air quality data for a specific city by selecting from a list of available cities.
This feature is particularly useful for users who want to check the air quality of their city or any other city of interest.

2. Determining a Station by a Point on the Map: This feature allows users to select a specific point on an interactive map, and the app will automatically locate the nearest air quality monitoring station.
This can be especially useful when planning trips to locations where air quality can vary significantly over short distances.

3.Interactive Data Display: The application presents air quality data in an easy-to-read table and graph format.
Users can dynamically interact with the data, enabling them to better understand the trends and patterns in air pollution levels over time.

4.Calculation of Largest, Smallest Values and Trend: The application provides statistical analysis of the air quality data,
calculating the maximum, minimum, and trend values. This feature aids in understanding the overall air pollution scenario by providing summarized statistical data.

5.Filtering Data by Selected Parameters: Users can filter the air quality data based on selected parameters, allowing for more tailored and focused analysis.

6.Downloading Data in CSV Format: For offline analysis, the application allows users to download the air quality data in CSV format.


The application is built on the Streamlit framework and uses a SQLite database for data management.
It also leverages several libraries, including folium, requests, json, geopy, pandas, numpy, and unidecode, to handle various tasks such as data analysis, geolocation, and data visualization.
